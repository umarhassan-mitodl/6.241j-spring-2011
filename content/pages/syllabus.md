Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Course Objectives
-----------------

The course addresses dynamic systems, i.e., systems that evolve with time. Typically these systems have inputs and outputs; it is of interest to understand how the input affects the output (or, vice-versa, what inputs should be given to generate a desired output). In particular, we will concentrate on systems that can be modeled by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), and that satisfy certain linearity and time-invariance conditions.

We will analyze the response of these systems to inputs and initial conditions. It is of particular interest to analyze systems obtained as interconnections (e.g., feedback) of two or more other systems. We will learn how to design (control) systems that ensure desirable properties (e.g., stability, performance) of the interconnection with a given dynamic system.

Course Outline
--------------

The course will be structured in several major sections:

1.  A review of linear algebra, and of least squares problems.
2.  Representation, structure, and behavior of multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) linear time-invariant (LTI) systems.
3.  Robust stability and performance. Approaches to optimal and robust control design.

Hopefully, the material learned in this course will form a valuable foundation for further work in systems, control, estimation, identification, signal processing, and communications.

Assignments
-----------

### Homework

Generally handed out every Wednesday, and due in class a week later (except as noted on schedule), at which time solutions will be handed out.

### Tests

There will be two exams: a take-home midterm exam issued in Lecture 13 and due two days later, and a final exam during final exam week.

### Grading

The course grade will depend on: (a) your involvement in the subject (30%), as evidenced mainly by your homework, but also by your interaction with the TAs and instructor; (b) your performance on the midterm exam (30%), and the final exam (40%).

Notes and Texts
---------------

The course notes are required, and are available in the {{% resource_link bd44ad36-f5b6-870b-74dd-fff31d2d3017 "Readings" %}} section.
